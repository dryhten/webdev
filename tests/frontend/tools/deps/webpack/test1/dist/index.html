	     so I want to use both logash and my index.js script file
	     to do this I would have to import both of them here in
	     the right order

	     to avoid this - you can use webpack: in index.js import
	     lodash, and then run webpack on index.js

	     first, install lodash: npm install --save lodash

	     ./node_modules/.bin/webpack src/index.js dist/bundle.js

	     this example is taken from official doc
