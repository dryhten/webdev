Flux is about how to structure your app. You split it into different
components like: Views, Actions, Dispatcher, Stores.

How the app behaves:
You have user interactions -> action creators -> actions -> dispatcher ->
  store -> change events (eventemitter) + store queries -> react views
  which update stuff

View: UI things
  * this can use React
  * in that case, a view is a React component
Action: some abstract thing
  * this is just some structured data
Dispatcher: some sort of control thing
  * you can use flux package for this
Store: where data lives
  * this usually uses EventEmitter
