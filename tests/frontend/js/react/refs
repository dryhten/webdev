# TODO move this to proj/webdev

# react is a js library (like jquery)
# to use it you need to import/load it in your js files
# I guess you can also generate a react.min.js and use that
# but the default development process is using imports
# so you need webpack (frontend/tools/deps/webpack)

# react uses more stuff than just import that is not supported by js
# at least that's how the documentation/tutorials are written
# it uses ES6 style and JSX (some other type of style)
# so you need something to convert from ES6 and JSX to normal javascript
# babel can do that; you can use it by itself or use the babel-loader in webpack
# this process of converting from one src code to another is called transpiling

# react init
# install webpack (npm init etc)

# install the babel loader (along with the react preset)
# just like normal babel, install it on the dev side (and not production)
# https://github.com/babel/babel-loader
npm install --save-dev babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-env babel-preset-react

# install react
npm install react react-dom --save

# then configure the babel loader in webpack config file
# add the "react" preset as well (for jsx)
"presets": ["env", "react"]

# then run webpack and it should work
webpack

# to avoid running webpack everytime you change the js file
webpack --watch
