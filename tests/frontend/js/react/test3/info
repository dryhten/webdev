Express (Node.js) + React.js
  webpack (to build bundle.js)
  nodemon app.js

you can do both at the same time (webpack --watch and node app.js) with webpack-dev-server
this is a node.js server that uses express

webpack-dev-server
  npm install webpack-dev-server
  ./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --progress --colors --content-base views

I have no idea how it knew to use public dir for static files
safest way to go would be to place bundle.js in same dir as index.html
and use that as content-base
