Button component example (no children here):

```js
<Button />
```

You can also set props to custom values (to the wrapper?)

```js {"props": {"mvar": 100}}
<Button nvar="10" />
```

By default you can edit values in the editor you see after "view code".
If you want to disable that use `noeditor`. This will remove the "view code" button.

```jsx noeditor
<Button />
```

You can also highlight source code - that is, it will show all the time

```jsx static
import React from "react";
<Button />
```
I guess you can achieve the same thing with ```html

```html
<Button />
```
