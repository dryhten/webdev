# turning silex (2.0.4) on for apache 2
# taken from https://silex.symfony.com/doc/2.0/web_servers.html

# first you have to turn rewrite mod on (mod_rewrite)
# check if it's on
apache2ctl -M | grep rewrite

# if it's not, turn it on
sudo a2enmod rewrite

# write a .htaccess at the root of the host/document
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    Options -MultiViews

    RewriteEngine On
    #RewriteBase /path/to/app
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]
</IfModule>

# if the .htaccess is not at the root, uncomment RewriteBase
# with the correct path

# this also works (from heroku official repo)
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]

# this second method seems much simpler (for apache >= 2.2.16)
# add this directive to .htaccess or directly to the VirtualHost
FallbackResource index.php

TODO play around with this (+ doc) maybe from scratch
other things to look at:
* special args in a function Application & Request
* type hinting
* for post you need $app->post
* $app->match will match all methods
