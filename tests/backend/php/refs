# having a custom php.ini in your site dir
# add this to your site/vritual host configuration file (e.g. 000-default.conf)
PHPINIDir /var/www/html/

# then place the php.ini in /var/www/html/
# apparently PHPINIDir is global and can be set only once TODO test this
# instead of using multiple php.ini files, you can use .htaccess files
# to change php values, e.g.
php_value upload_max_filesize 10M

# current version of PHP installed
7.1.8-2+ubuntu14.04.1+deb.sury.org+4

# apache has native php processing
# some web servers (nginx) don't, so we need to install a php processor
# and tell nginx to use it with php pages (assuming we want to use php
# in the same way)
# e.g. php-fpm (fastcgi process manager) - this will run alongside the server
# currently I have php-fpm7.1
# running various commands (similar to apache/nginx)
sudo /etc/init.d/php7.1-fpm status
sudo /etc/init.d/php7.1-fpm restart

# you can interpret individual files like this (without browser support)
php file.php

# opening an interactive console
php -a
