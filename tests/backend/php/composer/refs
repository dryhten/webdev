# composer helps with dependencies for PHP
# after you made a PHP website and used different packages/frameworks
# just create a file composer.json at the root of your website
composer.json
{
  "require" : {
    "silex/silex": "^2.0.4",
    "monolog/monolog": "^1.22",
    "twig/twig": "^2.0",
    "symfony/twig-bridge": "^3"
  }
}

# when you try to run your website on a different machine, you can get
# the exact same versions of the packages you used
composer install

# to get composer go to https://getcomposer.org/
# download the installer and run it (or just copy + paste from their website)
php installer

# this will get you composer.phar (php archive)
# to be able to run this globally, move it to a dir in PATH, e.g.
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

# after you add something new to the .json file (to download it)
composer update

# you can also modify the json from the command line
composer require alrik11es/cowsayphp
