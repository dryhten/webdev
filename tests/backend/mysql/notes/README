  * there is a problem with new lines on textarea
  * intuition: maybe they get lost when I select the text in javascript
    and I post it to the edit_note page

index.php is the main page; if the user is logged in this should display
  a list with all the notes; if not, it should redirect to login.php

login.php is the login page; this just includes various components like the
  login_form.php; this should redirect to index.php if the user is
  already logged in

signup.php is the signup page; after the user signs up he is redirected to
  the login page (after a 3s timeout).

edit_note.php is the note editing page; this is used both on a new note
  (POST["action"] = "add") and when editing one ("action" => "edit")

logout.php & delete_note.php are just PHP scripts to destroy the session
  and to run a delete query in the DB

All of these pages use common elements (e.g. the navbar). There are probably
different ways to achieve this (e.g. use only one page and some variables).
The way I did it is probably similar to a template engine (jinja) where I
wrote the different components in a separate file and for each main page
(index, login, signup) I used a different file where I included the components.

Most of the PHP logic is done at the top of the pages. If a certain message
needs to be displayed somewhere random in the page (e.g. login/signup error
messages), then I print some hidden divs at the top, and put the content in
the right place using javascript. Instead of mixing HTML with PHP too much
(which I don't like), I could've used more includes at various points in
the HTML file (in retrospect, this sounds easier than what I did).

Update: I used the second approach for the edit_note page, since the first
one didn't work for no apparent reason.

When you edit a note, the whole note text gets sent via POST so the DB
won't be queried twice.
