# the webserver has this interface called CGI (common gateway interface)
# this is how programs/scripts that run on the server interacts with it
# I assume PHP, javascript (node.js), python etc all interact with the CGI
# FastCGI is a faster version of CGI

# stopping apache2 from starting after boot
sudo update-rc.d -f apache2 disable

# adding a new virtual host/site
1. place a new conf file in /etc/apache2/sites-available/
   (e.g. cp 000-default.conf new-host.conf)
2. edit the file
   *:80 means allow any IP on port 80 (maybe change port)
   documentroot should point to the right thing
3. create link in sites-enabled
   * sudo ln -s ../sites-available/new-host.conf ./
   or use a2ensite
   * a2endsite new-host
4. if you changed port (from 80), make sure you have an apache proc listening there
   in ports.conf
   Listen new-port
   (after restart "sudo netstat -tlnp | grep apache2" to check)
5. if the new documentroot is not in /var/www or /usr/share, make sure to add it to
   apache2.conf
   <Directory new-dir> ... (copy from /var/www)
6. restart apache2
   sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

(also, make sure you have the right permissions on the dir, e.g. for www-data)
