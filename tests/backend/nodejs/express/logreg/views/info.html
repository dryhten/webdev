Hello, first you need to start the webserver:<br>
node logreg.js<br>
nodemon logreg.js<br><br>

The files are in backend/nodejs/express/logreg<br>
Both version 1 and 2 do the same thing, but there is a small difference in implementation<br>
There should be a version 3 with cleaner code<br>
Then you need to go to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ or /index or /index.html<br><br>
