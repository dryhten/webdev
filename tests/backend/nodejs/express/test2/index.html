Hello, first you need to start the webserver:<br>
node bin/www<br>
nodemon bin/www<br>
npm start<br><br>

Last one works if you have a correct "start" target in package.json.
You can also prefix/set the DEBUG env var to test:*/express:* if you want to enable the
debug module, e.g.<br><br>

DEBUG=test:* nodemon bin/www<br><br>

The files are in backend/nodejs/express/test2/<br>
Then you need to go to http://127.0.0.1:3000<br><br>

The project was generated with express generator.
