# so graphql is this alternative to rest api
# instead of having multiple api endpoints you only have one
# that is more generic and should be more maintainable
# you also perform fewer backend requests
http://graphql.org/

# GraphQL = graph query language
# it's just the standard for how to write the query/select what you want
# since graph ql also specifies how to interact with that one endpoint
# there are several packages/implementations for it (like graphql-js and
# apollo-server for javascript)

# official docs
http://graphql.org/learn/

# some external website with docs/tutorials
https://www.howtographql.com/

# it also has tutorials on using graphql with different
# frontend & backend technologies like node.js & react
https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/
https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction/

# getting started (javascript)
http://graphql.org/graphql-js/

# options for graphql on the backend
graphql.js (basic) - http://graphql.org/graphql-js/
express-graphql - http://graphql.org/graphql-js/running-an-express-graphql-server/
apollo-server - https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/

# graphql + express
npm install express express-graphql graphql
app-express.js

# once it's set up, you can send graphql requests to that api via POST
# (why did we use only a middleware then??)
# the data in POST should be a json, if you want to query it should have
# a query field, e.g.
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"query": "{ hello }"}' \
http://localhost:4000/graphql

# a better way to query the server would be to use the GraphiQL
# if you use graphql + express it should be there if you enable it
# in graphiql you can run the same query like
{
  hello
}

# running a query with an arg
{
  returnNumber(num: 10, secret: "my secret")
}

# running a query for your own type/object
# you also need to specify what you want from the obj
{
  returnMyType(arg: 10) {
    arg,
    getArg
  }
}

# you can also pass arguments to fields like so
{
  returnMyType(arg: 10) {
    inc(someNumber: 100)
  }
}

# I guess you can nest these as much as you like
# you can also be more explicit that it's a query
query {
  hello
}

# this allows for a distinction between queries and mutations
# to run a mutation (something that modifies data on server)
mutation {
  setMessage(message: "hello")
}

# running a mutation with curl
curl -XPOST \
-H 'Content-Type:application/graphql' \
-d 'mutation { setMessage(message: "My message") }'

# graphql + apollo-server
npm install apollo-server-express body-parser express graphql graphql-tools
https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/

# apparently you only need apollo-server-[variant]
# variant can be express, koa, hapi etc

# apollo engine is this tool that allows you to see meta info about your apollo server
# like performance tracing, caching???, error tracking etc
https://www.apollographql.com/docs/engine/setup-node.html

# you generate a token for your apollo-server, then see this info in the web panel/ui
https://engine.apollographql.com/login

# I guess apollo engine works as a service in the middle, so the queries and results
# will go there first

# you need to install apollo-engine package
npm install apollo-engine --save

# on the client side you can do custom POST/GET messages to interact with
# GraphQL backend or use a GraphQL client like
Relay - https://facebook.github.io/relay/
Apollo Client - https://www.apollographql.com/client/

# you usually use apollo client with a view framework like React
# apollo client installation - easier to use with apollo boost
npm install apollo-boost react-apollo graphql-tag graphql --save

# example of react + apollo
