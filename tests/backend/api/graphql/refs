# so graphql is this alternative to rest api
# instead of having multiple api endpoints you only have one
# that is more generic and should be more maintainable
# you also perform fewer backend requests

# some external website with docs/tutorials

# getting started (javascript)
http://graphql.org/graphql-js/

# graphql + express
app.js

# once it's set up, you can send graphql requests to that api via POST
# (why did we use only a middleware then??)
# the data in POST should be a json, if you want to query it should have
# a query field, e.g.
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"query": "{ hello }"}' \
http://localhost:4000/graphql

# a better way to query the server would be to use the GraphiQL
# if you use graphql + express it should be there if you enable it
# in graphiql you can run the same query like
{
  hello
}

# running a query with an arg
{
  returnNumber(num: 10, secret: "my secret")
}

# running a query for your own type/object
# you also need to specify what you want from the obj
{
  returnMyType(arg: 10) {
    arg,
    getArg
  }
}

# you can also pass arguments to fields like so
{
  returnMyType(arg: 10) {
    inc(someNumber: 100)
  }
}

# I guess you can nest these as much as you like
