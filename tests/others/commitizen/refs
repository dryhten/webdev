# commit messages in a standardized way (e.g. conventional commits)

# when you commit a message a prompt will show up guiding you through the commit
# installing commitizen
npm install -g commitizen

# you also need to select a standard (adapter)
npm install -g cz-conventional-changelog

# make a config file for commitizen (globally)
~/.czrc
echo '{"path": "cz-conventional-changelog"}' > ~/.czrc

# now you can commit with commitizen, in your repo
git cz

# instead of doing it globally, you can also do it for projects
# you still need commitizen cli globally so
npm install -g commitizen
commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exact

# or run it from local project
npm install commitizen --save-dev
./node_modules/.bin/commitizen ...

# this will do a bunch of things
1. it installs cz-conventional-changelog in repo (with save)
2. it adds the standard to commitizen config in package.json
   "config": {"commitizen": {"path": "cz-conventional-changelog"}}, ...

# if you commit failed because of some error messages
# instead of retyping everything do
git cz --retry
