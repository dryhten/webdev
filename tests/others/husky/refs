# npm package for git hooks
# so you can attach functions when you run a git command
https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky

# installation
npm install husky --save-dev
# or
yarn add husky --dev

# now you can edit package.json and add scripts like
{
  "scripts": {
    "precommit": "npm test",
    "prepush": "[some cmd]",
    ...
  }
}

# apparently not that hard to add your own git hooks (in .git/hooks)
