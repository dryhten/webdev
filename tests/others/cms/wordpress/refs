db: wordpress
user: wp_user

wordpress user
username: admin
password: admin

installation:
  1. create db + user for wordpress (mysql)
  2. unzip wordpress files
  3. rename wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php
  4. edit wp-config.php with info and w/e
  5. open the wordpress dir in a browser (the index.php should
     handle the install)

the wp-content needs writable permission (for www-data) after install (to upload files)
e.g. chmod g+w wp-content

also, to enable image manipulation (e.g. image cropping and rotation etc) you have to install
php-gd (graphics draw?)
e.g. sudo apt-get install php5-gd
