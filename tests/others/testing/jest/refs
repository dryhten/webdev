# installation
npm install --save-dev jest
# or yarn
yarn add --dev jest

# jest will look for files like *.test.js and run them
# it will also use some jest specific stuff, so you can use
# new syntax in those files
test("description", (args) => {expect(fcn(args)).toBe(expected)});

# examples in refs.test.js

# then just run jest
./node_modules/.bin/jest

# or add it to "scripts": {"test": "jest"} to avoide node_modules/.bin

# so jest is built on some smaller packages you can use directly like

# checks changes in files since last git
jest-changed-files

# shows a nice diff e.g. between objects
jest-diff

# getting doc blocks from a chunk of code (string)
jest-docblock

# alternative to typeof(); returns null for null
jest-get-type

# validating config submitted by user?
jest-validate

# some workpool thing
jest-worker

# print javascript values in a nice format
pretty-format

# you can configure jest in package.json/jest.config.js/--config
https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html

# api
https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/api.html

# each file is a test suite
# test suites are tested in parallel
# jest will run files like
*.test.js
*.spec.js
__tests__/*

# to run an individual suite specify the name
npm run test refs.test.js

# apparently it does some pattern matching
# only()/skip() is suite/file level

# you can also generate tests coverage
jest --coverage

# TODO continue here
